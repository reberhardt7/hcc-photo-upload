			<span>Harvest Community Church Photo Upload Box</span>
			<p>
				On Sunday July 19, Harvest will celebrate our 20th anniversary
				as a church. We will be looking back over the last 20 years at
				God's great faithfulness to us as a church family, as well as
				seeking His guidance together for the next chapter. One way we
				would like to celebrate is to put together some multimedia with
				photos from our history. If you have any old photos from your
				time at Harvest, we would appreciate if you could kindly upload
				them for us! Simply drag photos you have into the box below, or
				click the box to select photos from your computer. You may also
				upload from a smartphone!
